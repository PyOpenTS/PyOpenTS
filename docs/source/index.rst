PyOpenTS
--------

PyOpenTS is a library specifically designed to integrate methods and modules for time series. Its purpose is to allow users of this library to call and modify time series modules in a simpler and more convenient way. By using PyOpenTS, you can simplify the time series code process and reliably provide time series related module functions.  

Our Goal
--------

Our goal is to simplify the process of handling time series code so that users can more easily tackle various time series problems. Whether you are a data scientist, an engineer, a researcher, or someone interested in time series, PyOpenTS will be a powerful tool for you.  

Features
--------

- A clean API for quickly calling and modifying time series modules
- Provides a range of methods and models for time series analysis, including but not limited to forecasting, clustering, classification, etc. 
- Continuous updates and improvements to meet user needs

Installation
------------

Use the following commands below::

    pip install -u opents
